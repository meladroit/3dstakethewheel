# 3dstakethewheel
## an installer for oot3dhax

3dstakethewheel is a save injector from which you can install an OoT3D savefile and accompanying payload for regionFOUR and (someday) ninjhax2. regionFOUR is confirmed working on 9.9 JPN N3DS.

My work is entirely superficial. Most of the work here is due to yellows8 on oot3dhax, and smealum for getting it working with ninjhax-type payloads and for the ironhax installer.

## Prerequisites
* a 3DS
* tubehax, at least, or some kind of working homebrew
* oot3dhax savefile for your region
* a working ninjhax payload for your region and FW version
 
## Instructions
* Place the 3dsx, smdh, and xml in sdmc:/3ds/3dstakethewheel/ along with save02.bin (your oot3dhax savefile) and payload.bin (your regionFOUR or ninjhax payload).
* Run from hbmenu, making sure to select your OoT gamecard as the target app.
* Confirm that it went through. If it didn't, try formatting your OoT3D save data (press ABXY while the game is starting up).
* Enjoy!
